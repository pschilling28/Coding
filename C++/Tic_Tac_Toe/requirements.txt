Prerequisites:
1. In order to complete this project, you should have completed the following sections of Learn C++:
    Loops
    Vectors
    Functions

Make sure to plan out the program on paper before you start coding and remember to take breaks!

Youâ€™ll need to account for the following:

    This game will have two players that will input in the same terminal.
    This 3x3 game board will need to be represented using a data structure, like a vector or an array.
    There are 8 winning combinations.

Project requirements:

2. Loops: This program should use a for loop or while loop to iterate through the player turns.

3. Vectors: This program should use a vector or an array to hold nine positions of the 3x3 grid.

4. Functions: This program should be modular.
